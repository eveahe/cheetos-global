# Ch-ch-check your cheetos.

This is a simple memory-style game I made to help me learn more about react. Because it's my first react app, the structure is all over the place. May or may not try to clean it up later. 

One critical difference is that unlike a typical memory app, you're not matching _exact_ photos, but rather cheetos (or cheeto-ish snacks) from the same country.
